 <h1>Detailed Lesson Concepts</h1>

  <div class="lesson">
    <h2 id="lesson-1">Lesson 1 The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
     <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to process communication across the Internet.  HTTP is the protocol used to communicate between my computer and servers.The world wide web is collection of HTML Documents. Major components of the Internet include the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>My computer/browser</li>
          <li>The Internet</li>
          <li>Servers</li>
          <li>HTTP</li>
        </ol>  
    <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
      <p>Elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. </p>
    <h3>What a Web Page is</h3>
      <p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
    <h3>How Coding Works</h3>    
      <p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
        <br><i>"I'm learning to code!"</i>
        <br>look like this:
        <br><i>"I'm <b>learning</b> to code!"</i></p>
    <h3>Computers are Stupid</h3>
      <p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").</p> 
    <h3>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h3>
      <p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.</p>
    <h3>Basic HTML Vocabulary</h3>
      <p>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.
      </li>
	     <li>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
      </li>
      <li>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element.
      </li>
    </ol>

      <h3>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</h3>
        <p>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>

      <h3>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h3>

        <p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>

      <h3>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h3>

        <p>When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p>

      <h3>Text Editors (for programming)</h3>

        <p>When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.</P>

  <h2 id="lesson-3">Lesson 3 Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
    <h3>Style Tag Example</h3>
      <p>You can use the style tag to apply style as follows:</p>
  <div class="style_test"><p>This text should be blue</p></div>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
      <p>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</p>
      <p>CSS controls the style of elements in HTML</p>
      <p>CSS allows programmers to eliminate repetitive code decreasing the chances for errors.  When possible repeated code should be eliminated to as mentioned above decrease the opportunity for errors to occur.</p>

    <h3>Methods for including CSS Styling in Web Pages</h3>

      <p>Include CSS in the heading of HTML - This Method is good for smaller projects</p>
      <p>Link HTML to a separate CSS - This requires additional steps but is more organized.</p>
      <p>Write your style <em>inline</em> with your HTML - Typically a bad idea creating a lot of repeated code.</p>
